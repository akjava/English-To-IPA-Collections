# English-To-IPA-Collections
Programs and data for converting English text to IPA with MIT/Apache2.0/BSD licenses.Recently focus on Web.

In this Repo,I'll list dictionaries and examples

## Collections
### Dictionaries
- cumdict-ipa_simplified_vowel-aligned
### Javascript-converter
see this code  - https://github.com/akjava/English-To-IPA-Collections/blob/main/examples/matcha_tts_speak.html
### Python Converter
DeepPhonemizer - https://github.com/as-ideas/DeepPhonemizer en_us_cmudict_ipa_forward is almost same
## Working Demo
Huggingface:<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Akjava/Match-TTS-ONNX">Match-TTS Onnx with Arpabet to IPA</a><br>
<br>
Github page:<a href="https://akjava.github.io/English-To-IPA-Collections/">JS Example</a>

## Future Plan
- create onnx with DeepPhonemizer's en_us_cmudict_forward
- implement g2p_en's Algorithm of 1&2 and create onnx with their model

## License
**Anyway follow the CMUDict license.**

Converting from Arpabet to IPA is core things.

My dictionary and script and mini-bart-g2p depends on CMUDict.

mini-bart-g2p trained with CCBY4 LibriSpeech Alignments:https://zenodo.org/records/2619474
